# Princeton Applied Research M250/270 electrochemistry data cleaner
Working up data from this device was *really* tedious (see, [workflow video I made for colleagues] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU0EtnfCsc8)); I'm writing a python script to automate the process and save hours of mindless work.

So far I've got the initial formatting done (still have to separate into runs), but you'll have to define files in the python script itself and I haven't tested it on Windows since I only have Linux at the moment.
