# Princeton Applied Research M250/270 electrochemistry data cleaner
Working up data from this device was *really* tedious (see, [workflow video I made for colleagues] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU0EtnfCsc8)); I'm writing a python script to automate the process and save hours of mindless work.  
It has a catchy and memorable name so exhausted 4th year grad students doomed to use the namesake software can find salvation with a Google search.

So far I've got the initial formatting done (still have to separate into runs), but you'll have to define files in the python script itself and I haven't tested it on Windows since I only have Linux at the moment.
